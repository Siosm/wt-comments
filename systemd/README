# How to use systemd to launch wtcomments

## /var/run/wt

To make sure /run/wt is created at boot (/run and /var/run on tmpfs),
simply put the wtcomments.conf file in /etc/tmpfiles.d/


## systemd service unit

In order to use systemd to launch spawn-fcgi which spawn wtcomments' fcgi
process, copy wtcomments.service to /etc/systemd/system/.

Then reload systemd unit files with:
# systemctl --system daemon-reload

To start it, use:
# systemct start wtcomments.service

And to enable it for startup at boot:
# systemctl enable wtcomments.service
