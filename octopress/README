# WtComments for Octopress

The installation of WtComments on octopress isn't that hard. Just follow these
steps:

- Copy wtcomments.html to $your_octopress_tree/source/_includes/
- Include the plugin in source/_layouts/(page|post).html

The way I personnaly include the plugin is by using the following snippet:

	{% if page.comments == true %}
		<section>
			<h1>Comments</h1>
			{% include wtcomments.html %}
		</section>
	{% endif %}

You may also want to replace Disqus references from the modified files.

You should be all set and ready :)
