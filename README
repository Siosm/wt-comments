# Wt Comments

Wt Comments is a project that was written in order to allow users to comment on
static websites (such as http://www.mupuf.org).

The goal was to create a secure, minimal and self-standing binary that would
serve user's comments as needed. These comments are to be stored in a JSON
file.

I wanted a program that would run under a specific UID (using FCGI or a
built-in http server) and that would provide strong separation between
code and data in order to limit the risks posed by this service to the system.

I decided to write this project in Wt, a C++ Web Framework that I have been
looking into using for a while now, because it satisfied all my
pre-requirements and allowed the usage of hardware and gcc security features
such as the NX bit and canaries.

The program has been written with portability in mind. However, it is currently
limited to Linux due to one simple function (getExeDirectory()). Feel free to
send me patches ;)

## Dependencies, Installation, Execution

Please have a look at INSTALL and if necessary systemd/README (systemd is
completely optional and only used for managing the Wt process).

## Octopress integration

Please have a look at octopress/REAME.

## Upgrade notes

Before commit 8869027, comment thread database files were named by the full URL
including the protocol used to access the comments. Thus if you served your
blog on both HTTP and HTTPS, comments were split across two files. Starting
from commit 8869027, the protocol is stripped but Wt-comments won't strip
previous comment thread filenames. In order to keep old comments you should
just rename (and eventually merge) those files manually.
