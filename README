# Wt Comments

Wt Comments is a project that was written in order to allow users to comment on static websites (such as http://www.mupuf.org).

The goal was to create a minimal and self-standing binary that would serve user's comments as needed. These comments are to be stored in a JSON file.

I decided to write this project in Wt, a C++ Web Framework, because I didn't want a dependency to scripting engines such as Python, Ruby or PHP.

The program has been written with portability in mind. However, it is currently limited to Linux due to
one simple function (getDBDirectory()). Feel free to send me patches ;)

## Installation

### Tiny MCE
In order to use Wt Comments, you'll need to first download tiny MCE:
wget http://github.com/downloads/tinymce/tinymce/tinymce_3.5.7.zip

Then, extract tiny MCE and copy the inner tiny_mce folder to /usr/share/Wt/resources/
The file /usr/share/Wt/resources/tiny_mce/tiny_mce.js should now exist.

### Database
The comments database is stored as separate JSON files. Each file represents a comment thread.

These files are meant to be stored in the db/ folder of wtcomments' binary's folder. Please create this folder:
$ mkdir db/

You should be ready for the first test run!

## Execution

Please launch this project with the following command line:
$ ./wtcomments --docroot /usr/share/Wt/ --http-address 0.0.0.0 --http-port 9090 

Then open the url http://127.0.0.1:9090 and enjoy!
